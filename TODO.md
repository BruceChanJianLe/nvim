## TODOs
- Fix telescope fzf native (from time to time this will happen) cd `$HOME/.local/share/nvim/lazy/telescope-fzf-native.nvim` and cmake it!
  Missing libfzf.so but strictly speaking lazy should be able to handle it.
- re-org the keybindings, T - toggle group, e.g. toggle term, toggle renu, toggle tressitter context, etc.
- swtich header and source (c++)
- quick jump to next and previous if else statements
- open buffer to selected window from neotree
- show function signature (c++)
- do not add header by default, must trigger lsp action
- center cursor when `gd` going to definition
