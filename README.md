# NeoVim

This is a nvim repository that aims to be as easy to use as vscode.

## Plugin Manager

I am using [Plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) to manage my plugins in neovim, until 0.5 version is stable will switch to [Packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim).

To update all plugins on startup of nvim, please refer to [here](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug/wiki/extra#automatically-install-missing-plugins-on-startup)
